	<p> My name is Alyssa Lynn Catalanotto, 
	I've grown up shy and extremly sensitive. 
	Through the last few years in Pelham Middle
	School I've experienced many degrating
	events but also many uplifting events to my
	confidence. I been having a great year 
	so far creating new friends and exploring MY 
	true likes and dislikes NOT society's.  </p>
